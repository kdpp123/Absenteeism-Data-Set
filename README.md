# Absenteeism-Data-Set
Absenteeism Prediction Using Machine Learning
Description: This project focuses on predicting whether an employee will be absent from work based on various factors using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes multiple features, such as the distance from work, the number of children, the number of pets, and other personal and workplace-related factors.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model Building: Built and trained machine learning model Logistic Regression.
Outlining the model: Model is created using python module
Feature Importance: Analyzed the importance of different features like distance from work, number of children, pets, and other factors to understand their influence on absenteeism.
Prediction Accuracy: Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to ensure reliable predictions.
Prediction on new_data: At last the prediction is made on the new data set with our absenteeism module.
How to Use:

Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies using requirements.txt.
Run the Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and make predictions.
The models can be further tuned or used as a base for similar classification tasks.
Future Improvements:

Experiment with more advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
Explore additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.
Dataset: The absenteeism dataset was used to build the prediction model, including personal, work-related, and other factors contributing to absenteeism. Dataset is already provided in files.

Tableau: At last the results of the predicted data is fetch to Tableau to produce some visual insights
